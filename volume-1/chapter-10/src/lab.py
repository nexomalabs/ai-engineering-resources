"""Lab 10 — Writing Your First Professional Prompts (starter).

Volume I capstone. Five exercises pair a WEAK prompt against a STRONG one on
the same task, each demonstrating one failure mode from Chapter 10 section 9:
ambiguity, format, hallucination, constraint violation, missing structure.

This file RUNS as supplied against recorded fixtures, no API key needed. All
five check functions are stubs that return False, so every exercise reports
"Fix demonstrated: no". Complete the five TODOs — one check function each.
