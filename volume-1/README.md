# Volume I — Laboratories

*Applied AI Engineering · Volume I: AI and LLM Fundamentals*

Every lab runs from a clean checkout and is tested in CI on every push.

**Python 3.15.** Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then from any lab directory:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python src/lab.py     # your starting point
uv run pytest                # verify your work
```

**Estimated API cost for the whole volume: under $1.00.** Labs 1 through 7 run entirely
locally with no model calls.

## `shared/`

Helpers imported by labs across the volume. Standard library only, so it stays
importable in a bare environment.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `nexoma_labs.costs` | `Price`, `CostLedger`, `estimate` — token cost accounting, introduced in Chapter 9 |
| `nexoma_labs.fixtures` | `FixtureStore`, `lab_mode` — recorded model responses so labs test without an API key |

```bash
cd shared && python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .   # 17 tests
```

### Lab modes

Labs that call a model honour `NEXOMA_LAB_MODE`:

| Mode | Behaviour | Used by |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `fixture` *(default)* | Replay recorded responses. No key, no cost. | CI tier 2 |
| `record` | Call the real API and save responses to `fixtures/` | Author, when writing a lab |
| `live` | Call the real API, save nothing | CI tier 3, nightly |

A changed prompt produces a different fixture key and fails loudly rather than
replaying a stale answer.

## Recording the video companion

Record against a **tagged release** of the companion repository and put the tag in the
video description. Each lab's `README.md` is the recording outline: *What You Will Build*
is the intro, *Setup* and *Running It* are the demo, *Expected Result* is the payoff, and
*If It Does Not Work* pre-empts the comments.
